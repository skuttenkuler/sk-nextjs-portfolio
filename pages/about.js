                <p className={styles.bio}>&emsp; My name is Sam Kuttenkuler and thank you for visiting my site. I am a Full Stack Engineer with a Bachelorâ€™s of Science from Middle Tennesse State University.
                    I have spent the last 4 years designing and developing applications for the web and mobile mediums. In 2020, I completed course 
                    work at the University of California, Berkeley Bootcamp and received a certificate in Full Stack Web Development. 
                    <br/>&emsp;Creative and curious. Diligent and meticulous. Previously a professional musician, I brought my all to delivering experiences. 
                    I bring that same passion and drive for user experience with every product I ship. I am an adamant pursuer and lover of tailoring memories and moments while aiming to leave lasting impressions with everyone that uses my apps.
                    I pride myself on being a relentless problem solver and voracious learner. 
                    Every product I build and ship is carefully planned, developed, and designed to give the user the exact experience my client aims to give from the tech stack to the UX/UI.
                    I have been successful in this approach being a detail oriented programmer while remaining in a big picture mindset. If you have an idea for an application, please visit my contact page and let's build something great.
